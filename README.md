# CMS395 - Mobile App Development - Project 4

This is project 4 for CMS395 - Mobile App Development at Rollins College

Our instructions are:

 *  Write an app that allows a user to create, save, and retrieve mini notes.

 *  To do this, create a database to hold each note, the date each note was written, and its subject (the user will give this to you).

 *  Limit each note to 125 characters.

 *  In one activity, allow the user to create and save a note.
 
 *  In a second activity, allow the user to retrieve their mini notes based on date or subject. Bind the date and subject data entry fields to the database using ArrayAdapters.

 *  Implement menus to allow the user to move between activities.

 *  Separate the database functionality into a DatabaseManager class (as we did with the Tipper). Tipper is a program that our professor is developing in class as an example of concepts covered in lecture.

 *  Deliverables:
      * Upload your project .zipped.
      *  A printout of your .java files, your .xml files, and your model
